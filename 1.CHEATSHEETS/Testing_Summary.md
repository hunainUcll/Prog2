Absolutely! Here's a **detailed summary** of everything you've learned in this lesson, organized by topic:

---

## âœ… 1. **Test Structure: Arrange, Act, Assert**

You learned the **3-phase structure** for writing readable and maintainable tests:

* **Arrange**: Set up all necessary objects and state.
* **Act**: Execute the behavior you want to test.
* **Assert**: Check that the behavior had the expected effect.

This structure improves test clarity and debugging.

Example:

```python
def test_task_becomes_overdue():
    # Arrange
    today = date(2000, 1, 1)
    calendar = CalendarStub(today)
    task = Task('desc', date(2000, 1, 2))
    sut = TaskList(calendar)
    sut.add_task(task)

    # Act
    calendar.today = date(2000, 1, 8)

    # Assert
    assert [task] == sut.overdue_tasks
```

You also learned to use `sut` as a convention for the **"System Under Test"**.

---

## âœ… 2. **Writing Focused Unit Tests**

You wrote specific test functions to cover different use cases:

### âœ… `test_creation`

Check that a new `TaskList` starts with:

* No tasks
* Empty `due_tasks`, `overdue_tasks`, `finished_tasks`

### âœ… `test_adding_task_with_due_day_in_future`

Add a task whose `due_date` is in the future and ensure it's in `due_tasks`.

### âœ… `test_adding_task_with_due_day_in_past`

Try to add a task in the past and expect a `RuntimeError`.

### âœ… `test_task_becomes_finished`

Mark a task as finished and ensure it moves from `due_tasks` to `finished_tasks`.

These tests follow Arrangeâ€“Actâ€“Assert and are deterministic (you use fixed dates like `2000-01-01`, not `date.today()`).

---

## âœ… 3. **Using `setup_function` to Share Setup Code**

You used a **`setup_function()`** to avoid repeating code across tests:

```python
def setup_function():
    global today, tomorrow, calendar, sut
    today = date(2000, 1, 1)
    tomorrow = today + timedelta(days=1)
    calendar = CalendarStub(today)
    sut = TaskList(calendar)
```

Each test automatically gets a fresh copy of the setup **before it's run**. This promotes **test isolation**.

### ðŸ“› Limitations:

* `setup_function` often becomes bloated.
* It runs *every time* even if the test doesn't use all its variables.
* If something goes wrong in `setup_function`, **all** tests fail.

---

## âœ… 4. **Pytest Fixtures: Better Alternative to `setup_function`**

You learned that **fixtures** are the recommended way in Pytest to reuse setup logic cleanly.

### ðŸ”§ Fixtures use `@pytest.fixture` and support **dependency injection**:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture
def today():
    return date(2000, 1, 1)

@pytest.fixture
def tomorrow(today):
    return today + timedelta(days=1)

@pytest.fixture
def calendar(today):
    return CalendarStub(today)

@pytest.fixture
def sut(calendar):
    return TaskList(calendar)
```

### Benefits:

* Fixtures only run if **needed** by a test or another fixture.
* Clean and modular: each fixture has a **single responsibility**.
* Avoids cascading failures if one fixture breaks.
* Dependencies between fixtures are **explicit** via function parameters.

### Usage in tests:

```python
def test_creation(sut):
    assert len(sut) == 0
```

Pytest automatically injects `sut` (and any dependencies like `calendar` and `today`) by calling the appropriate fixtures.

## âœ… 5. **Importing from Parent Folder**

You asked how to "hop back one folder" to import files in Python.

### ðŸ›  Options:

| Method                       | Description                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sys.path.append(...)`       | Manually add the parent directory to the import path.         |
| `PYTHONPATH=.. pytest`       | Temporarily include parent dir when running tests.            |
| `from ..module import Class` | Relative imports (inside a proper package with `__init__.py`) |

## âœ… Summary of Best Practices Learned

| Concept                   | Summary                                                              |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Arrange-Act-Assert**    | Improves structure and clarity of tests.                             |
| **Test Isolation**        | Each test must be independent â€” use setup/fixtures to ensure this.   |
| **Use `sut`**             | Make the "System Under Test" (main object) explicit in naming.       |
| **Avoid `date.today()`**  | Use fixed dates for deterministic tests.                             |
| **Use Fixtures**          | Preferred over `setup_function`; faster, more modular, less brittle. |
| **Parent folder imports** | Use `sys.path`, `PYTHONPATH`, or relative imports inside packages.   |
